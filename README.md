# Code Refactor
In this project, I learned to lean on my peers and my own instincts for support. I also learned the importance of attention to detail, and the trial and error of completing a webpage. I was able to grow my understanding by doing the following things:




* I added alt tags to all photos to meet accessibility standards
* I made all links operational

* I made the code semantic, to make it more elegant and readable
  * By doing this, I was able to eliminate repeditive classes and combine styles for multiple elements
